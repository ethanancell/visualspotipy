Username can be found by going to your settings in the desktop app.
client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri are all made in the
Spotify Developer Dashboard. Create an app there and link it to visualspotipy.

Also, create a file called client.py in the root directory with the following variables:
username = 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_USERNAME'
client_id = 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_APP_CLIENT_ID'
client_secret = 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_APP_CLIENT_SECRET'
redirect_uri = 'http://localhost/'
